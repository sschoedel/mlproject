## Dataset

The dataset used for this project was pulled from the following Git repository:
```
https://github.com/deathlyface/recaptcha-dataset
```

This dataset contains thousands of images for 11 different reCAPTCHA classes. The classes `Chimney`, `Motorcycle`, and `Mountain` all contained fewer than 100 images, so we elected to remove them from the dataset. The 8 remaining classes were split into a training and testing dataset were split with the ratio 70/30, and stored in this repository within the directories `Train` and `Test`.
